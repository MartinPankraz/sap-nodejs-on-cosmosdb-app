# Azure Cosmos DB with SAP Private Link quickstart sample

Example project showcasing a resilient **multi-region** app on SAP BTP powered by globally distributed **Azure Cosmos DB**. App was built upon the SAP Developer tutorial [Create a Node.js Application via Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-cf-buildpacks-node-create.html) and the SAP Private Link for [Cosmos DB](https://help.sap.com/docs/PRIVATE_LINK/42acd88cb4134ba2a7d3e0e62c9fe6cf/663ed5631cfd4ef0a4bd89ca00266943.html). It relies on [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) instead of [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for a leaner setup.

This repos and associated [üìùblog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/27/sap-private-linky-swear-with-azure-global-scale-with-azure-cosmos-db-with-sap-private-link/) shed light on the private connectivity aspect. To complete your resiliency journey, have a look at **intelligent routing** in this joint Microsoft+SAP [Discovery Center mission](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3603/) and this [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/06/11/sap-where-can-i-get-toilet-paper-an-implementation-of-the-geodes-pattern-with-s4-btp-and-azure-cosmosdb/).

## Getting started üöÄ

Create `SampleDB` from **Quick Launch wizard** in Cosmos DB on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customportal=false#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.DocumentDb%2FdatabaseAccounts).

Create a [SAP Private Link for Cosmos DB](https://help.sap.com/docs/PRIVATE_LINK/42acd88cb4134ba2a7d3e0e62c9fe6cf/663ed5631cfd4ef0a4bd89ca00266943.html) named cosmos-pls or rename service in [manifest.yml](manifest.yml)

Run SAP Business Application Stuido or compatible IDE of your choice (I like [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for ready to run environments).

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/MartinPankraz/sap-nodejs-on-cosmosdb-app.git
cp templates/.env app
```

Maintain your cosmos credentials in the `.env` file. From Cosmos DB UI navigate to Settings -> Keys -> read-write Keys -> Primary Key.

```cmd
cd app
npm install
npm start
```

Navigate to the addresses tab and enjoy the private response from Cosmosü™ê‚òÑÔ∏è

> **Warning** - when executing **locally** you need a connection to your SAP Private Link service (remember Cosmos is not publicly reachable!). Have a look [here](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/10/05/btp-private-linky-swear-with-azure-how-do-i-debug-and-test-with-live-data/) how to use ssh with cf.

## Deploy to BTP ü™Ç

Adjust route in manifest.yml as per [SAP's recommendation](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-cf-buildpacks-node-create.html) in step 2.

```cmd
cf push
```

## Full blown setup üåè

Above architecture can be considered a mix of high-availability and failover concepts. How so? The SAP Private Link in each BTP CloudFoundry space is configured to be able to reach both Cosmos regions and the app layer responds to the end-user as per the intelligent routing setting (fastest, closest etc.).

Consider the [ABAP SDK for Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/ABAP-SDK-for-Azure) for additional interaction scenarios with Cosmos DB.

As you can see there is a variety of choice of data bases for your BTP app with different capabilities and implications. The associated [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/27/sap-private-linky-swear-with-azure-global-scale-with-azure-cosmos-db-with-sap-private-link/) and prototype use [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) in a multi-region setup with **provisioned throughput**.
